        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the Midwest, and as a kid loved reading, playing sports and thinking hard. In my early years I had an interest in learning musical instruments, and eventually started taking piano lessons. Once into that I also started learning music theory, and faced the new challenge of creating my own music. Even though my musical career never took off, the creative part of me still likes making pieces, mostly for my own enjoyment. Most of the work that I have done has involved the outdoors, and the tough challenges I have faced have helped me gain a solid work ethic. I am now entering the new world of coding, and am confident that whatever environment is ahead I have the skills and determination to thrive in it.  </p>
